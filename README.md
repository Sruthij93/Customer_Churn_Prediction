# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project is part of my work as a Software Engineering Resident in the Headstarter Accelerator program. 
It aims to predict customer churn using a Kaggle dataset of bank customers by analysing customer behavior and building machine learning models that accurately predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank (churn).

## Project Overview

This project executes different machine learning models for churn prediction.

### Dataset

I used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, containing bank customer data with features like customer age, account balance, tenure, and whether or not they churned. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers?resource=download).

### Models Explored

Several machine learning models were trained and tested, including:

- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **XGBoost**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **Stacking Classifier**

To further improve model performances, the following techniques were implemented:

### Performance Improvement Techniques

1. **Feature Engineering**

2. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**  

3. **Ensembling**
